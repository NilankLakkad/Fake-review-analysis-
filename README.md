## **How It Works**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Reviews are cleaned and tokenized.
   - Features are extracted using TF-IDF for numerical representation.

2. **Model Training**:
   - Trained Logistic Regression and Random Forest models on 32,000 reviews.
   - Optimized hyperparameters for improved performance.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Input reviews are classified as fake or genuine with ~93% test accuracy.
